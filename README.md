## Setting Up Local Use

1. Clone the repo from GitHub.

2. Open the root folder in VSCode.

3. Run NPM install to run all dependencies.

4. To create your database, run npx sequelize.

5. Create a .env, and copy the .env.example file into it.

6. Create the Sequelize database, and then migrate the database and add seeders.

7. Open a second terminal. In one, go into the backend directory and run npm start. In the other, go into the frontend directory and run npm start. This should start up both servers and open the app in your browser.
